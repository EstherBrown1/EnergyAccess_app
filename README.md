# EnergyAccess_app

### App Name: ElecAfrica ###
App Set - Up:
This app was originally implemented in and iOS environment.
In the app, the user session begins when he or she registers as a new new user in the ElecAfrica app.
After registration, the user is then added to the database of users in the backend. Alternatively, the user can just log in with his or her username or password, if already registered.
Once they are in the app, users can swipe left to get to the "News on electricity access by country" page.
On this page, users filter to get news updates from a specific country by swiping up to find their country of choice.
Once a specific country is selected, users can swipe through all the different access updates which are inputed by other users and verified with other web sources on the backed for accuracy using web-scraping methodologies.
For example, users can check updates on the current population size, rural and urban access, energy leadership, and non-solid fuels percentage for each country of their choice
Additionally, users can also click on the "CONNECT WITH AFRICAN VOICES BUTTON" on the "News from ___(Country of Choice)___ page where they can select to connect with other users and organizations classified in either the Local Voices, Diaspora Voices, or Global Voices category.
Connect with Others Interested in the Issue:
On the connect page, when two users choose to connect, they can choose to use an-in app iMessage system to chat if both users are using iOS devices.

Discussion 
Overall, this app could be useful to organizations or individuals interested in energy access across Africa or in specific countries. 
Also, since this is more of a social app, based on social-network principles, the app would become more useful over time as more people join and upload news updates to the database. Over time, this would allow for an increase in the frequency of news updates in the app. 

Additionally, the in-app messaging system could help connect locals affected by energy access directly to leaders in charge of addressing the issue. This connection would make sure that local voices are heard in every step of the energy access decision-making process.

The next step in the app cycle is to adapt it to an android environment. This would allow more users to use the in-app messaging system across both Android and iOS devices.
